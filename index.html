                <p>
                    I am a 25 year old male human.  I have been programming for 7 years, and producing and recording music for about 10 years.  I have been playing guitar since I was 10 years old, and drums since I was 14 (although I am a completely self-taught drummer).  I am always looking for interesting ways that I can put either my programming or musical abilities to good use. So if you need someone to help you with your technology needs, your sound needs, or both, I'm your guy.

                    <p>
                        Lazy Rabbit likes to make relaxing jazzy hip hop beats and eats lettuce. He binge sleeps, and is awake at odd hours. He lives in a cave, and produces all of his music at home at Rabbit Hole Studios. You can find his music and social media things at <a href="http://lazyrabbitmusic.com" target="_blank">lazyrabbitmusic.com</a>.

                    <h2>Lawrence</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lawrence is a band lead by the soulful brother and sister duo Clyde and Gracie Lawrence. They write music that can be described roughly as soul-pop, with heavy motown and funk influences. Lawrence's debut album, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/breakfast/id1083201159" target="_blank">Breakfast</a>, is on available iTunes, Spotfy, and most other music selling websites.  You can follow Lawrence's various fun and active social media channels: <a href="https://instagram.com/lawrencetheband/" target="_blank">instagram</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lawrencetheband" target="_blank">facebook</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrencetheband" target="_blank">twitter</a> <a href="www.lawrencetheband.com">website</a>

                    <h2>Pow Pow</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pow Pow is a very different band. They play rock music, sometimes, but they always use instruments. Their sound is punk-rockish at times, and also somewhat folk inspired. I guess you could call it "alternative rock", whatever that means. They're based in New York, and have some recorded music at <a href="http://powpowisaband.com" target="_blank">powpowisaband.com</a>.

                    <p>
                        The Inspectre makes glitchy funk inspired dance music. He likes to try to dance like a robot, and stays up all night looking for other ghosts to party with. He lives in high orbit in his Space Lounge, piloted by a crew of incredible funk and jazz musicians. You can find his work at <a href="http://inspectrefunk.com" target="_blank">inspectrefunk.com</a>.
